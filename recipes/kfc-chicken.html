    <h1>How to make KFC chicken</h1>
    <img src="kfc-chicken.jpg" alt="Image of kfc-chicken">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        They said it couldn’t be done—but dare we say our homemade version of KFC™ fried chicken is better than the original recipe?<br>
        We start with a flavorful combination of 11 spices you already have in your pantry and combined them with flour and brown sugar to create the makings of that savory KFC™ crunch you crave.<br>
        After that, it doesn’t get any easier than dredging the chicken and frying it up in hot oil.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 tablespoon paprika </li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons onion salt </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon chili powder </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon black pepper </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon celery salt </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon dried sage </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon dried basil </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram </li>
        <li> 1/2 cups Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon brown sugar </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon kosher salt </li>
        <li> 1 whole chicken (2 breasts, 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks, 2 wings) </li>
        <li> 1 egg white </li>
        <li> 2 quarts neutral oil, for frying </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat fryer to 350°F. Thoroughly mix together all spices. </li>
        <li>Combine spices with flour, brown sugar and salt. </li>
        <li>Dip chicken pieces in egg white to lightly coat them, then transfer to flour mixture.<br>
            Turn a few times and make sure the flour mix is really stuck to the chicken. Repeat with all the chicken pieces. </li>        
        <li>Let chicken pieces rest for 5 minutes so crust has a chance to dry a bit. </li>
        <li>Fry chicken in batches. Breasts and wings should take 12-14 minutes, and legs and thighs will need a few more minutes.<br>Chicken pieces are done when a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 165°F. </li>
        <li>Let chicken drain on a few paper towels when it comes out of the fryer. Serve hot. </li>
    </ol>
