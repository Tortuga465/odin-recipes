    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A blondie (also known as a blonde brownie) is a variety of dessert bar. It resembles a chocolate brownie, but substitutes vanilla in place of cocoa, and contains brown sugar. <br>Blondies also contain flour, butter, eggs, and baking powder and may also contain walnuts or pecans, white or dark chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, or other flavored chips.<br>
        Blondies differ significantly from white chocolate brownies. Unlike the white chocolate brownie or the normal brownie, they contain no chocolate or chocolate flavouring, other than chocolate chips, which may be included. <br>They may also contain coconut, nuts, toffee, or any other chunky candy for added texture. Blondies are not usually frosted; the brown sugar tends to be sweet enough. A variation is the Congo bar, which contains chocolate chips with either walnuts or coconut.<br>
        They are baked in a pan in an oven in a manner similar to that of the baking of traditional brownies, then they are cut into rectangular shapes for serving. Blondies are sometimes served in sundaes, often topped with caramel sauce.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup shortening</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups light brown sugar, packed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 + 1/3 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped pecans</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl cream the shortening and brown sugar. Mix in the water and vanilla. Then add the eggs. Mix until combined.</li>
        <li>In another bowl whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda. Gradually add it to the sugar/egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chocolate chips and pecans.</li>
        <li>Drop by rounded tablespoons onto an ungreased baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake for 7 - 9 minutes (8 was exactly perfect for me). Let the cookies cool slightly before removing them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
